# Exercise 1.2.5
# Q1: How many rows are in penguins? How many columns?
glimpse(penguins)
#A: (Rows: 344, Columns:8)
# Q2: What does the bill_depth_mm variable in the penguins data frame describe? 
penguins?
# A: The bill_depth_mm variable in the dataset is a number thhat denotes penguin bill depth measured in milimeters 
# Q3: Make a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm. That is, make a scatterplot with bill_depth_mm on the y-axis and bill_length_mm on the x-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables.
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)
) +
  geom_point()
#A: There apears to be a positive relationship between the two variables but the strength is not salient.
# Q4: What happens if you make a scatterplot of species vs. bill_depth_mm? What might be a better choice of geom?
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = species)
) +
  geom_point()
# A: It would be easier to visualize the data using a density plot with different color lines to show the species. (Example shown below)
penguins |> 
  ggplot(#data = penguins,
         mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
                       colour = species)) +
  geom_density(linewidth = 2)
# Q5: Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?
#A: The code gives an error related to the labeling of the x and y axis information. To fix you would use this code.
penguins |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
                       y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point()
