# Exercise 9.5.1 (2-5)
#...
#Q2: What does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?
# A: The geom_col() function has different default stat than geom_bar(). The default stat of geom_col() is stat_identity(), which leaves the data as is.
# A_Continued: The geom_col() function expects that the data contains x values and y values which represent the bar height.
#...
#Q3: Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?
#A: The following tables list the pairs of geoms and stats that are used in concert.

#Table: Complementary geoms and stats

#These pairs of geoms and stats tend to have their names in common, such `stat_smooth()` and `geom_smooth()`, and  be documented on the same help page.
#The pairs of geoms and stats that are used in concert often have each other as the default stat (for a geom) or geom (for a stat).
...
#Q4: What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What parameters control its behavior?
#A: The function stat_smooth() calculates the following variables:
#y: predicted value
#ymin: lower value of the confidence interval
#ymax: the upper value of the confidence interval
#se: standard error
#The “Computed Variables” section of the stat_smooth() documentation contains these variables.
...
#The parameters that control the behavior of stat_smooth() include
#method: the method used to
#formula: the formula are parameters such as method which determines which method is used to calculate the predictions and confidence interval, and some other arguments that are passed to that.
...
#Q5: In our proportion bar chart, we needed to set group = 1. Why? In other words, what is the problem with these two graphs?
#A: If group = 1 is not included, then all the bars in the plot will have the same height, a height of 1. The function geom_bar() assumes that the groups are equal to the x values since the stat computes the counts within the group.
#A_Continued: The following code will produce the intended stacked bar charts for the case with no fill aesthetic.
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop.., group = 1))
